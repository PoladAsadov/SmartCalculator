Intorduction:
This application is a voice-activated, smart calculator designed using Python. It integrates multiple libraries to create a rich user interface that supports both click and voice commands to perform mathematical operations.
To run the application, ensure Python and libraries such as Tkinter, pygame, PIL, and speech_recognition are installed. Execute the script from your preferred environment

Users can interact with the calculator through a graphical interface or by using voice commands. The application supports basic arithmetic, trigonometric, logarithmic functions, and has sound feedback features.

Singleton Design Patter:
The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of the App class exists. This avoids duplication and ensures that the application's state is centralized and consistent.
class Singleton(type):
    _instances = {}
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]


Encapsulation is used to hide the internal state of the application, such as the window title (__title), which is set privately within the class. This protects the application's data integrity and prevents external modifications.
class App(Tk, metaclass=Singleton):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.__title = "Smart Calculator"

Inheritance allows StandardButtonFactory to derive from the abstract ButtonFactory class. It inherits the create_button method template and provides its specific implementation, allowing for consistent button creation across the application.
class ButtonFactory(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def create_button(self, root, text, command=None):
        pass
class StandardButtonFactory(ButtonFactory):
    def create_button(self, root, text, command=None):
        return Button(root, text=text, ...)

Abstraction is demonstrated by defining an abstract base class (ButtonFactory) that specifies a method (create_button) but leaves the implementation details to its subclasses. This approach abstracts the button creation process, decoupling the button specification from its creation.
class ButtonFactory(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def create_button(self, root, text, command=None):
        pass
Polymorphism is shown here as the create_button method is implemented differently across different factories. This specific implementation allows the application to handle different button types dynamically at runtime.
class StandardButtonFactory(ButtonFactory):
    def create_button(self, root, text, command=None):
        return Button(root, width=5, height=2, bd=2, ...)


The Factory Method pattern is used to create buttons through a centralized StandardButtonFactory. This method standardizes the creation process and makes the application easier to maintain and modify.
factory = StandardButtonFactory()
buttons = ["C", "+", "=", ...]
for label in buttons:
    button = factory.create_button(root, label, lambda: click(label))
    button.grid(...)
